This PCB was mounted inside the cabin of the UFV an listened for data to be sent by the controller. On receiving the joystick positions, the Arduino Nano set the correct PWM signal to the motor drivers in order to move the
wheels/nozzle motors in the correct direction with the correct speed. The PCB was designed in Kicad and manufactured by JLCPCB.
